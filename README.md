After downloading the `port.exe` file, run it with administrator privileges.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This application **requires administrator privileges** to modify Windows Firewall rules.
- When you run the program, **Windows will prompt you with a UAC (User Account Control) dialog** asking for permission.
- This is normal and expected ‚Äî the app needs elevated access to create or delete firewall rules.
- Since the executable is **not digitally signed**, the prompt may show **"Unknown Publisher"**.  
  If you downloaded the `.exe` from this project's official [Releases](https://github.com/penu18/windows-port/releases) page, it is safe to proceed.
