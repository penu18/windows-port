# windows-port

A simple Python GUI application for managing Windows Firewall ports (open/close for TCP, UDP, or both) using the `netsh` command.

## Features

- Delete existing rules
- Check and list open firewall ports
- Simple graphical interface built with Tkinter

## Security Warnings (First Run)

Since this application modifies system firewall settings, **Windows will prompt security warnings**. Here's how to safely proceed:

### 1. Windows Defender SmartScreen

If you downloaded the `.exe` version (e.g., `port.exe`) and run it for the first time, SmartScreen may block it.

#### Initial warning:

#### Expand and proceed:

Click on **"More info"**, then **"Run anyway"**.

> üõ° This is a standard behavior for unsigned applications. You can safely proceed if you trust the source (this GitHub repository).

### 2. User Account Control (UAC)

After bypassing SmartScreen, Windows will prompt with UAC to confirm admin access:

> üîê This is **required** for modifying firewall rules. If you deny, the application won't function properly.

## Application Interface

Once allowed, the Port Manager application launches:

- Enter a port number
- Choose TCP, UDP, or Both
- Add/Delete rules
- Check currently open ports
